# Injury Prediction Volleyball

Task : Injury prediction based on journal data from the Dutch national menâ€™s volleyball team 

Description: The volleyball data concerns a single player, who is being monitored on a daily basis by means of a questionnaire of health and wellbeing. Additionally, there is information about the different training events, both on the court as well as in the gym. A data science approach needs to be developed that provides insight into how the player responds (in terms of injuries and complaints) to various training loads. It is expected that load is captured using some traditional load measures, as well as by some more data driven indicators. The choice of data processing and modeling technique is up to the student.
